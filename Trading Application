The code implements a trading application with a premium version, utilizing object-oriented programming concepts. The BasicTradingApp class serves as the foundation, providing methods for depositing, withdrawing, buying, and selling cryptocurrency, as well as viewing account details and transaction history. The PremiumTradingApp class inherits from BasicTradingApp and overrides the viewAccountDetails() method to offer additional features for premium users.
The application features a menu-driven interface, allowing users to interact with the system by selecting options from a menu. The main() function employs a switch statement to handle user input and execute the corresponding actions. This design enables users to easily navigate the application and perform various tasks, such as managing their account balance, buying and selling cryptocurrency, and viewing their transaction history.
The code demonstrates a clear separation of concerns, with each class responsible for a specific aspect of the application. The use of inheritance and polymorphism enables the creation of a premium version of the application, providing additional features and functionality for premium users. Overall, the code provides a solid foundation for a trading application, with a user-friendly interface and a robust set of features.
